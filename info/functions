wc-engine functions that need an explanation:

int wce_create_planet(long seed)

It creates pseudorandomly the basic parameters for the world that uses the weather and climate simulation.
And the function creates an array of data.

Most entries have a size of 8 bytes because of the very common 64 bit machines. It is safer to use 8 bytes
instead of 4 bytes, which could cause issues.

[byte]  |   [content]

0-15    |   name of the world

16-23   |   temperature of the sun (kelvin)

24-31   |   diameter of the sun (meters)

32-40   |   distance from the sun (meters)
